Here is the implementation of media download from telegram channel using python. Also partial implementation of question extraction.
If anyone wants to download media then run telegram.py. Also add your own api_id,api_hash which you can get from https://core.telegram.org/api
And once you run the code enter the contact no and the code. After that type the channel name from which media is to be downloaded when asked.
